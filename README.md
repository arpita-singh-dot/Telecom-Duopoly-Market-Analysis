<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problems</h2>

ðŸ“Œ Duopoly (Airtel vs Jio)
- How can the companies optimize pricing to attract customers without hurting profitability?
- What factors are driving changes in market share between the two competitors?
- Which customer segments are more profitable, and how can companies retain them?
- How to identify revenue growth opportunities in a highly competitive duopoly market?

ðŸ“Œ Churn (Telecom Churn Analysis)
- Which customer characteristics most influence churn behavior?
- How can we predict churn early to take preventive action?
- What retention strategies can reduce churn while keeping acquisition costs low?
- How do contract type, monthly charges, and tenure affect churn probability?

<h2><a class="anchor" id="research-questions-key-findings"></a>ðŸ“Š Research Questions & Key Findings</h2>

Research Questions:
- How do revenue and customer growth trends differ between the two telecom companies over time?

- What strategies can each company adopt to gain a competitive edge in the duopoly market?

Key Finding:
- Jio disrupted with **free data (buffet style)**, Airtel stayed **premium (fine dining)**.  
- Together they control **80%+ of the market** (true duopoly).  
- **Churn is highest** among short-tenure & month-to-month contracts.  
- Investors love the rivalry â€” both stocks trend upward.
